# @fulcro/transform-core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 597a05c: Each library now ships its own compile time transformer.

  `@fulcro/reflect` exposes `@fulcro/reflect/transformer` and
  `@fulcro/reflect/unplugin`. Installing the package is enough; there is no second
  thing to install and no way to end up with the utilities but not the transformer
  that resolves them.

  **Breaking, and released as a minor**, which the pre-1.0 convention allows.
  Point the `plugins` entry of your tsconfig at `@fulcro/reflect/transformer`
  instead of `@fulcro/transformer`, and import bundler adapters from
  `@fulcro/reflect/unplugin`. The transformer itself is unchanged — same options,
  same emitted code.

  **This release also repairs 0.2.1.** That version declares a peer dependency on
  `@fulcro/transformer`, which no longer exists on the registry, so
  `npm install @fulcro/reflect` fails outright with a 404 rather than merely
  warning. There is no peer here to go missing.

  `@fulcro/transformer` is gone. It was a peer dependency, which npm installs and
  Yarn does not, so a project could get the utilities with nothing to resolve them
  and no error to say so; and it versioned separately, so `reflect@0.3` with
  `transformer@0.2` was an installable, broken pair.

  `@fulcro/transform-core` is new, and holds the machinery that belongs to no
  library in particular. You never install it directly.
