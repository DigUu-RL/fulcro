# @fulcro/errors

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- c24bd4c: Every error now carries a stable `FULCRO` code, at the start of its message and
  as `error.code`: `TypeError: FULCRO6021: Vector3.from: missing field 'x'.` The
  class of each error is unchanged, so `instanceof` keeps working, but every
  message now starts with its code — code that compares a message as a whole, or
  anchors a pattern at its start, has to be updated. Match on `error.code`
  instead: the code keeps its meaning across releases, while the wording after it
  may improve.

  The codes live in the new `@fulcro/errors` package, which every other package
  depends on. What each one means, and what to write instead, is in
  `docs/errors.md`.

  `@fulcro/parallel`: an error thrown by a task inside a worker now rejects as
  `FULCRO3005` with the task's own message kept after the code; the library's own
  errors cross the worker boundary with their own code and class.
