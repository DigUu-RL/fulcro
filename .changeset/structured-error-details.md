Every error now carries `details`: the values its message was written from, by name and frozen, always with the `operation` that failed — `error.details.index` instead of reading the number back out of the message. Recognise one with `isFulcroError(error, 'FULCRO7002')`, which narrows `details` to that code's fields, or with `error instanceof FulcroError`; the built-in class (`RangeError`, `TypeError`) is unchanged, and `DetailsOf<'FULCRO7002'>` names one code's details. Messages and classes are unchanged. **Breaking, in `@fulcro/errors` only:** `createError(code, ...values)` is now `createError(code, details)`, so `createError('FULCRO6021', 'Vector3.from', 'x')` becomes `createError('FULCRO6021', { operation: 'Vector3.from', field: 'x' })`. `CodedError` remains as a deprecated name for `FulcroError`.
